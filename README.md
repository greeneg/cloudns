# CloudNS

This is the CloudNS project Git repo for YggdrasilSoft.

We do all development of the CloudNS appliance in the open.

# What is CloudNS?

CloudNS is a network services appliance built on top of Linux with Perl, Ruby, and Go.

The backing store for much of the software relies on coreos/etcd.

Much of CloudNS leverages or extends existing code with extra "glue" code from us to integrate the packages together.
